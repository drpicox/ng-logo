If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n\t *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n\t *   Examples:\n\t *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n\t *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n\t *\n\t * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n\t *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n\t *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web. You can specify an\n\t *   alternate font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the\n\t *   desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MdIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.\n\t *   Examples:\n\t *     <md-icon>home</md-icon>\n\t *     <md-icon fontSet=\"myfont\">sun</md-icon>\n\t *\n\t * - Specify a font glyph to be included via CSS rules by setting the fontSet input to specify the\n\t *   font, and the fontIcon input to specify the icon. Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n\t *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n\t *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n\t *   Example:\n\t *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n\t */\n\tvar MdIcon = (function () {\n\t    function MdIcon(_element, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n\t        this._element = _element;\n\t        this._renderer = _renderer;\n\t        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n\t        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n\t    }\n\t    /**\n\t     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n\t     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n\t     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.

If the svgIcon value contains a colon it is assumed to be in the format\n *   \"[namespace]:[name]\", if not the value will be the name of an icon in the default namespace.\n *   Examples:\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"left-arrow\"></md-icon>\n *     <md-icon svgIcon=\"animals:cat\"></md-icon>\n *\n * - Use a font ligature as an icon by putting the ligature text in the content of the <md-icon>\n *   component. By default the Material icons font is used as described at\n *   http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web.

Typically the fontIcon will specify a\n *   CSS class which causes the glyph to be displayed via a :before selector, as in\n *   https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/examples/\n *   Example:\n *     <md-icon fontSet=\"fa\" fontIcon=\"alarm\"></md-icon>\n */\nvar MdIcon = (function () {\n    function MdIcon(_element, _renderer, _mdIconRegistry) {\n        this._element = _element;\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._mdIconRegistry = _mdIconRegistry;\n        this.hostAriaLabel = '';\n    }\n    /**\n     * Splits an svgIcon binding value into its icon set and icon name components.\n     * Returns a 2-element array of [(icon set), (icon name)].\n     * The separator for the two fields is ':'.
